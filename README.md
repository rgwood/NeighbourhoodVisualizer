# Neighbourhood Visualizer

This is a web tool designed to help visualize the effect of various urban planning policies. The latest production version can be viewed [here](http://neighbourhood.reillywood.com/).

This is forked from my smaller-scale [Setback Visualizer](https://github.com/rgwood/SetbackTool) tool.

It's written in TypeScript using Angular, and it draws using the HTML Canvas API.

I'm keen to make this useful for real-world pedagogy. Just give me a shout if you have feature requests or bug reports!
