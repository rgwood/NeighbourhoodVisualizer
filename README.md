# Neighbourhood Visualizer

This is a web tool designed to help visualize the effect of various urban planning policies. It's forked from my smaller-scale [Setback Visualizer](https://github.com/rgwood/SetbackTool) tool.

It's written in TypeScript using Angular 5, and it draws using the HTML Canvas API.
